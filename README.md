KRITA_AI_DIFFUSION_QOL: The scripts in the AI Diffusion folder are meant to go into the appdata roaming krita pykrita folder

LOCAL_BOORU: Basically a local image booru I designed to look through images generated by stable diffusion, get their tag metadata and browse. 
				You'll have to go into image_booru.py and set your path at the top. It expects a folder with subdirectories where you store your images
				you really only need to have one folder with all your images in it but it can recurse through all subdirectories.
				Run RunImageBooru.bat to run. May require you to manually pip install libraries since I don't feel like setting up a requirements.txt
				
LORA Browser: Pretty straightforward Lora browser I made to make it easier to add loras to Krita prompts. Will really only work if you use civitaihelper
				in A1111/Forge to download both images and the civitai.info metadata from civitai.
